# PokerEngine

# A simple Python built Game Engine that can create a randomized
# 52 card Poker Deck and pull from it. The Poker Class contains
# functionality to construct and create storage for the deck
# along with class methods to employ functionality like building
# strings using object information. 

# Running PokerDriver.py will draw 4 separate hands and
# determine what the highest combo that each hand has
# available to play.
