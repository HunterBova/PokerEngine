# PokerEngine

A simple Python built Game Engine that can create a randomized <br />
52 card Poker Deck and pull from it. The Poker Class contains <br />
functionality to construct and create storage for the deck <br />
along with class methods to employ functionality like building <br />
strings using object information. <br />

Running PokerDriver.py will draw 4 separate hands and <br />
determine what the highest combo that each hand has <br />
available to play. <br />
